# **Parabolic throw trajectory simulator**
__ __ __ __ __
__ __ __ __ __
_Simulation of parabolic throw trajectory of objects (circle in this case) in 2D._ **PROJECT MADE FOR FUN**

### **Functionality**
__ __ __ __ __

Program simulates parabolic throw trajectory including:
* modifiable material and density of throwing object
* modifiable gravity field (or fields)
* wind simulation (initially as single force vector)
* air resistance

### **Installation**
__ __ __ __ __

Program uses [SFML.Net-2.2](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). Also x64-Architecture is needed for proper work of program.

To download project clone manualy or use `git clone https://github.com/RechnioMateusz/parabolic-trajectory-sim.git` command

To run simulation go to `..\ThrowSimulation\bin\Debug\ThrowSimulation.exe`
